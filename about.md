I'm Marek Marczykowski-GÃ³recki, a Linux developer and system administrator. I do things: ranging from basic services configuration, through Python or C programming, to kernel-level hacking.
You can find my contributions in various open source projects, including Linux kernel and Xen. 
I'm the lead developer of [Qubes OS](https://www.qubes-os.org/) and Chief Software Engineer at [Invisible Things Lab](https://invisiblethingslab.com/).

On this blog, you'll find some cool things I do as a part of my job and in my free time.
